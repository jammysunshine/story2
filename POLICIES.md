# Terms of Service & Privacy Policy for WonderStories AI
**Last updated: January 2026**

## 1. Parental Control & Family Safety
WonderStories AI is a **parental tool** designed for adults to create personalized stories for their families. **This service is not directed at, or intended for direct use by, children under the age of 13.**

*   **Authorized Users:** Only parents or legal guardians are authorized to create accounts and provide information. Our **Parental Gate** ensures that all story generation and purchase actions are performed by an adult.
*   **Information Control:** All data (such as a child's first name or features) is provided voluntarily by the parent for the sole purpose of generating a one-time story.
*   **Privacy First:** We do not collect "behavioral" data from children. We never sell or trade any personal information provided by parents.

## 2. AI Safety & Content Reporting
We use Google Gemini AI to assist parents in storytelling. We maintain a safe environment through:

*   **Pre-Generation Filtering:** Every parent-provided prompt is checked for safety before being processed.
*   **Manual Reporting:** Use the **"Report Content"** button on any page if the AI produces unexpected results. Reports are reviewed by human moderators within 24 hours.

## 3. Account Deletion
You have the right to be forgotten:

*   **Permanent Purge:** Deleting your account from the **"Account"** tab immediately and permanently removes your profile, your story library, and all generated images.

## 4. Terms of Service
*   **Personal Use:** Stories are for personal, non-commercial use by your family.
*   **AI Output:** Parents acknowledge that AI-generated content is experimental and may contain inaccuracies.
*   **Final Sales:** Due to the personalized nature of physical books, orders are final once printing begins.

## 5. Privacy Policy
*   **Data Security:** We use industry-standard encryption for all account and payment data.
*   **Essential Partners:** We share data only with necessary providers: Stripe (Payments), Gelato (Printing), and Google (AI Infrastructure).
